Code repository for final year research project (January to March 2024) conducted as part of the BSc Biomedical Science programme at KCL.

## Description
This repository is intended as supplementary information for the project write-up.

[preprocessing](/preprocessing): contains scripts used to preprocess nucleotide sequences into input datasets for use with the _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ gene expression neural network model trained by Zrimec et al., as described in their 2020 paper (DOI: [10.1038/s41467-020-19921-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19921-4)).

[predictions](/predictions): code to generate predictions with the aforementioned neural network model, using the prepared input datasets.

[analysis](/analysis): code to reproduce the data analysis and visualisations as reported in the write-up.
